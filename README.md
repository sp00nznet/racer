## What is this?

This is a **static recompilation** project for *Star Wars Episode I: Racer* on the Nintendo 64, using [N64Recomp](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp). The goal: take the original N64 binary and recompile it into native PC code, so you can podrace at modern resolutions and framerates without emulation.

No existing N64 decompilation exists for this game. We're flying blind through Beggar's Canyon here, folks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- GNU Make (or compatible)
- [N64Recomp](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp) (for recompilation step)
- Your own legally obtained ROM: `Star Wars Episode I - Racer (U) [!].z64`

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sp00nznet/racer.git
cd racer

# Place your ROM in the project root
cp /path/to/your/rom.z64 baserom.z64

# Run initial analysis
make

# Check progress
make progress
```

### Debug Tools

We've got a full pit crew of analysis tools, inspired by the DKR decompilation project:

```bash
# Analyze the ROM structure and regenerate symbols
make analyze

# Disassemble any function
make diff FUNC=func_80000470

# Dump all strings from the ROM
make strings

# Just the debug strings (source files, asserts, etc.)
make strings-debug

# Game text (menus, dialogue, taunts from Sebulba)
make strings-game

# File paths referenced in the ROM
make strings-files

# View recompilation progress
make progress
```

### Building (once N64Recomp is set up)

```bash
# Build N64Recomp first
cd /path/to/N64Recomp
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release

# Then recompile the game
cd /path/to/racer
make recomp N64RECOMP=/path/to/N64Recomp/build/N64Recomp
```

## Fun Stuff Found in the ROM

The developers at LucasArts left some gems in the binary:

- **Developer control schemes**: "---Jonk---", "---Jake---", "---Steve---", "---Alex---", "---Brett Sett---" - each dev had their own controller config!
- **Debug menu**: `Debug Level`, `Edit Vehicle Stats`, `AI Level x10` - there's a full debug menu hiding in there
- **Sebulba trash talk**: *"I could run faster than your podracer"*, *"Watto sell you that podracer?"*
- **Cheat codes**: `All Pods, tracks unlocked!!!`
- **Engine fire**: `ENGINE FIRE` - every podracer's nightmare
- **Low memory warning**: `Low Memory: %d Racers` - when the N64 couldn't handle all those pods

## How N64 Static Recompilation Works

```
  N64 ROM (MIPS)
       |
       v
  [N64Recomp] -----> Reads symbols.toml for function boundaries
       |
       v
  Recompiled C code (one file per ~50 functions)
       |
       v
  [C Compiler] + [N64ModernRuntime] (reimplements libultra)
       |
       v
  Native PC executable!
```

Unlike emulation, static recompilation converts every MIPS instruction into equivalent C code at build time. The result runs natively on your CPU - no instruction-by-instruction interpretation needed. This means better performance, easier modding, and native resolution/widescreen support.
